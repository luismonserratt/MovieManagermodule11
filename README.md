# 🎬 Movie Manager – Module 11 (Final Project with Javadoc)

Welcome! This repository contains the final version of my **Movie Manager** project, completed for **Module 11: Software Documentation**.

The goal of this module was to practice writing clear and professional **Javadoc comments**, and to generate full documentation for a working Java application.

## 📌 What This Project Does

This is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to manage a list of movies stored in a MySQL database. It includes:

- ✅ **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ A **Swing GUI** for user interaction
- ✅ Connection to a MySQL database using **JDBC**
- ✅ Well-structured classes with **Object-Oriented Design**
- ✅ Fully documented code using **Javadoc**

## 🧱 Key Classes

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Movie` | Represents a single movie with title, genre, rating, duration, etc. |
| `MovieDAO` | Data Access Object – handles all database operations |
| `DatabaseManager` | Establishes MySQL database connections |
| `MovieManagerGUI` | Swing-based graphical interface for user interaction |

## 📝 Javadoc Documentation

All public classes, constructors, and methods include clear and meaningful **Javadoc comments**, following best practices from Module 11.

The documentation was generated using IntelliJ IDEA and submitted as a `.zip` file on Canvas.

You can also include it in the `/docs` folder if needed.
